# Circum icons pack for React

This pack was created following Google material and IBM Carbon design principles. Our main goal was to keep a certain consistency throught all the set and insure that each icon has the same visual weight.

Available for these frameworks 👉 React, [Vue](https://github.com/Klarr-Agency/circum-icons-vue) and [Svelte](https://github.com/Klarr-Agency/circum-icons-svelte)
