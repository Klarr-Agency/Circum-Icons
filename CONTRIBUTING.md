## Icon Contribution
You need to be open mind about getting a `lot of revision` of your work as we really want our library to be consistent in its structure, style and simplicity. Don't get anything personal. If you are still interested in creating new icons for the community feel free to follow these steps.

### Please verify that there is no icon for that purpose!
- Open a issue with the template [icon request](https://github.com/Klarr-Agency/Circum-Icons/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=icon-request.md&title=) and a title of `Icon request: <icon name>`
- Download our template in [ai](https://github.com/Klarr-Agency/Circum-Icons/blob/main/templates/template.ai) or [eps](https://github.com/Klarr-Agency/Circum-Icons/blob/main/templates/template.eps) format and follow the instruction
- Export you icon in svg format
- Clean up your svg, you should keep the number of groups as minimal as possible
- On the first `<g>` tag you should have a id with the name of your icon and a data-author attribute with your github usersame
```
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <g id="At" data-author="Add your Github Username">
    <path d="M12.09,21.925a9.846,9.846,0,0,1-3.838-.747A9.673,9.673,0,0,1,3.005,15.93,10.034,10.034,0,0,1,2.244,12a10.425,10.425,0,0,1,.695-3.8,9.606,9.606,0,0/>
  </g>
</svg>
```
- When it's complete, you can fork our repository and add your svg export into the svg folder
- Create a pull request and link your pull request to your issue
- Relax and wait for us, we'll review your work ☕️
